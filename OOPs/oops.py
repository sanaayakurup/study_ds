message = "I have {:d} dollars and {:d} cents."
print(message.format(money.dollars, money.cents))
# "I have 27 dollars and 12 cents."

#This class was packaged into a library, and over time, was used in many different pieces of code, in many different applications. For example, one developer on another team - Bob - used it this way in his code:

money.dollars += 2
money.cents += 20
print(message.format(money.dollars, money.cents))
# "I have 29 dollars and 32 cents."        



# Fast forward a few months or years. Alice needs to refactor the internals of the Money class. Instead of keeping track of dollars and cents, she wants the class to just keep track of cents, because it will make certain operations much simpler. Here's the first change she might try to make:
# Second version of Money class.
class Money:
    def __init__(self, dollars, cents):
        self.total_cents = dollars * 100 + cents

#This change has a consequence: every line of code referencing a Money object's dollars has to be changed. Sometimes when this happens, you're luckily the maintainer of all the code using this class, and you merely have a refactoring job on your hands
# Fortunately, Alice knows a better way, which will let her avoid the whole more-fun-than-going-to-the-dentist thing: The built-in property decorator. @property is applied to a method, and effectively transforms an attribute access into a method call. Let me show you an example. Push that Money class onto your mental stack for a moment, and imagine instead a class representing a person
class Person:
    def __init__(self,first,last):
        self.first=first
        self.last=last
        
    @property
    def full_name(self): #instance method 
        return f'my full name is {self.first} {self.last}'

buddy= Person('Jonathan', 'Doe')
buddy.full_name     #this is kind of a dynamic attribute 
#Note that even though full_name is defined as a method, it is accessed like a member variable attribute. There are no parenthesis in that last line of code; I'm not invoking the method. What we've done is create a kind of dynamic attribute.

#back to the money class 
class Money:
    def __init__(self, dollars, cents):
        self.total_cents = dollars * 100 + cents

    # Getter and setter for dollars...
    @property
    def dollars(self):
        return self.total_cents // 100
    
    @dollars.setter
    def dollars(self, new_dollars):
        self.total_cents = 100 * new_dollars + self.cents

    # And the getter and setter for cents.
    @property
    def cents(self):
        return self.total_cents % 100
    @cents.setter
    def cents(self, new_cents):
        self.total_cents = 100 * self.dollars + new_cents   


# What does Bob's code look like now? Exactly the same!
# His code is COMPLETELY UNCHANGED, yet works
# with the final Money class. High five!
money = Money(27, 12)
message = "I have {:d} dollars and {:d} cents."
print(message.format(money.dollars, money.cents))
# "I have 27 dollars and 12 cents."

money.dollars += 2
money.cents += 20
print(message.format(money.dollars, money.cents))
# "I have 29 dollars and 32 cents."

# This works correctly, too.
money.ceNnts += 112
print(message.format(money.dollars, money.cents))
# "I have 30 dollars and 44 cents."
